                         GMSEC API Examples README
================================================================================

This file describes how to build the GMSEC API C, C++, and Java examples on
systems that support 'make'.


1) Define an environment variable for GMSEC_PLATFORM:

   * Set the variable to one of the following values depending on your platform

    - RHEL 6 x86_64       => linux.x86_64

    - RHEL 7 x86_64       => linux.x86_64

    - Mac OSX x86_64      => macosx.x86_64

   * For example,

       $ export GMSEC_PLATFORM=linux.x86_64


2) For Java examples, define environment variable for JDK_HOME:

   * For example,

       $ export JDK_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_73


3) Build programs using Makefile:

   * Execute 'make' to compile the examples; for example

       $ make
