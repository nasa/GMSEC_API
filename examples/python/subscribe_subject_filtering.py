 @file subscribe_subject_filter.py
 
 This file contains a simple example outlining how to subscribe
 to and retrieve messages from the middleware bus while using subject
 exclusion filtering to reduce the scope of a wildcarded subject subscription.

 This example program is intended to be run before starting the
 'publish_subject_filter' example program.
