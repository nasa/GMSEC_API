 @file subscribe_async.py
 
 This file contains a simple example outlining how to asynchronously subscribe
 to and retrieve messages from the middleware bus. Asynchronous receipt
 operations essentially mean that a Callback subclass is implemented, that the
 corresponding Callback object is registered to a subscription, and that
 messages are received asynchronously after starting the AutoDispatcher.

 This example program is intended to be run before starting the 'publish'
 example program.
