/// This class is the abstract base class for MIST event callbacks.
/// A user created class, derrived from this class, can be passed into %RegisterEventCallback() to have
/// user code executed asynchronously when an event (typically an error) occurs in the connection object.
/// Please note that because users are able to create their own ConnectionManagerEventCallback class, reentrancy
/// is not guaranteed unless if they implement their own reentrancy rules.
/// Also note that because a ConnectionManagerEventCallback can be registered to multiple connections,
/// it can be run concurrently amongst those connections.
