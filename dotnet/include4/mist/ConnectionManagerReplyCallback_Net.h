/// This class is the abstract base class for received replies from asynchronous request messages.
/// A user created class, derrived from this class, can be passed into
/// %Request() to have user code executed asynchronously when a reply is received or when an error occurs.
/// Please note that because users are able to create their own ConnectionManagerReplyCallback class,
/// reentrancy is not guaranteed unless they implement their own reentrancy rules.
/// Also note that because a ConnectionManagerReplyCallback can be registered to multiple connections,
/// it can be run concurrently amongst those connections.
