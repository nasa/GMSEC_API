/**

 * @brief Contains macros which make exporting from a DLL much simpler.
 *
 * All files within this DLL are compiled with the GMSECAPI_EXPORTS
 * symbol defined on the command line.  This symbol should not be defined on any project
 * that uses this DLL.  That way, any project whose source files include this file sees
 * the GMSEC_API functions as being imported from a DLL, whereas this DLL sees symbols
 * defined with this macro as being exported.
 *
 * THIS IS ONLY REQUIRED FOR WINDOWS PLATFORMS
