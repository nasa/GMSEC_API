/** @class ConnectionManager
 * @brief This class wraps the GMSEC Connection object, supplying both normal
 * middleware interaction functions and some additional quality of service. 
 * This is accomplished through standard services for producing Log and 
 * Heartbeat messages, as well as functionality for validating messages. 
 * 
 * If the object is configured to validate messages, all messages sent 
 * from this ConnectionManager via either Publish or Request will be compared
 * to an available schema definition. If a template definition for the message
 * in question is available, it will be validated. The message will not be sent
 * over the middleware if validation fails. Messages without a template
 * definition can be sent as well.
 *
 * The following messages are currently supported, and the Fields required for 
 * the ConnectionManager to recognize them are listed as well.
