 *  The following ifdef block is the standard way of creating macros which make exporting
 *  from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are compiled with the GMSECAPI_EXPORTS
 *  symbol defined on the command line. this symbol should not be defined on any project
 *  that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see
 *  GMSEC_API functions as being imported from a DLL, wheras this DLL sees symbols
 *  defined with this macro as being exported.
 *
 *  THIS IS ONLY REQUIRED FOR WINDOWS PLATFORMS
