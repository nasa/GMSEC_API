EXAMPLES

internal mutex example

{
	Condition condition;
	Mutex &mutex = condition.getMutex();

	mutex.enterMutex();

	int reason = condition.wait();
	printf("condition got %d\n", reason);

	mutex.leaveMutex();
}


external mutex example
{
	Mutex external;
	Condition condition(external);

	external.enterMutex();

	int reason = condition.wait();
	printf("condition got %d\n", reason);

	external.leaveMutex();
}


If the Mutex class is updated to keep track of its ownership, this can
be made more robust and use less code as:


internal mutex example with AutoMutex

{
	Condition condition;
	AutoMutex hold(condition.getMutex());

	int reason = condition.wait();
	printf("condition got %d\n", reason);
}


external mutex example with AutoMutex
{
	Mutex external;
	Condition condition(external);

	AutoMutex hold(external);

	int reason = condition.wait();
	printf("condition got %d\n", reason);
}
