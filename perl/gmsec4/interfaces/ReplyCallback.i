=head1 NAME

libgmsec_perl::ReplyCallback

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is the abstract base class for received replies from asynchronous request messages. A user created class, derived from this class, can be passed into request() to have user code executed asynchronously when a reply is received or when an error occurs. Please note that because users are able to create their own ReplyCallback class, reentrancy is not guarunteed unless if they implement their own reentrancy rules. Also note that because a ReplyCallback can be registered to multiple connections, it can be run concurrently amongst those connections. Because of this, the use of a gmsec::api::util::AutoMutex is suggested to enforce thread safety.

Example ReplyCallback class:

        {
            package MyReplyCallback;
            use base 'libgmsec_perl::ReplyCallback';

            sub onReply
            {
                    my ($self, $connection, $request, $reply) = @_;

                    libgmsec_perl::LogInfo("[MyReplyCallback::onReply]\n" . $reply->toXML());
            }

            sub onEvent
            {
                    my ($self, $connection, $status, $event) = @_;

                    if ($status->isError())
                    {
                            libgmsec_perl::LogError("[MyReplyCallback::onError] " . $status->get() . ", event=" . $event);
                    }
            }
        }

Example ReplyCallback registration:

        my $rcb = MyReplyCallback->new();

        my $requestMsg = libgmsec_perl::Mesage->new("GMSEC.MY.REQUEST", $libgmsec_perl::Message::REQUEST);

        # Add Fields to the message
        ...

        $rcb->DISOWN();
        $conn->request($requestMsg, $timeout, $rcb);

=head3 DESTROY

C<libgmsec_perl::ReplyCallback-E<gt>DESTROY()>

    Destructor.

=head3 onReply

C<libgmsec_perl::ReplyCallback-E<gt>onReply($connection, $request, $reply)>

        This function is called by the API in response to a reply recieved from a request, from within the request() call. A class derived from gmsec::api::ReplyCallback needs to be passed into the request() call.

        Please note that if a ReplyCallback is registered to multiple connections, onReply() can be invoked concurrently from the different connection threads.

        This function is called in response to a error after a call to registerEventCallback().

        Please note that if an EventCallback is registered to multiple connections, onEvent() can be invoked concurrently from the different connection threads.
